# Dense and Large Subgraph Detection via Lasry-Lions Double Envelopes - A Homotopy Approach

This is a code repository for our publication in "2026 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing (ICASSP)".

## Abstract
Extracting large and dense subgraphs is a key task in graph mining applications. Pre-existing formulations are either overly restrictive (the maximum clique) or yield sparsely connected subgraphs (the densest subgraph problem). The optimal quasi-clique (OQC) problem allows extraction of large cliques and near-cliques of different sizes via a tunable parameter, but is NP-hard, with no principled optimization algorithm known. We propose a novel homotopy-based framework for OQC based on the Lasry-Lions (LL) double envelope that enables efficient approximation via a sequence of smooth subproblems. Experiments on real-world graphs show that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art greedy baseline for OQC, extracting larger and denser (quasi)-cliques that the baseline fails to detect.
